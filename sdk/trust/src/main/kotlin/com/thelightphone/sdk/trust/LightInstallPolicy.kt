 * Local mirror of the Android-owned `ClientFilterLevel`, which this module cannot import:
 * `:sdk:server` is an Android library, and Gradle will not hand an `androidJvm` variant to
 * a `jvm` consumer. `:sdk:server` is expected to depend on this module, so the reverse edge
 * would be a cycle.
 *
 * The constants are named identically so the mapping between them stays a rename-free `when`.
 * Collapsing the two into one enum in `:sdk:shared` is deferred — it touches published API.
